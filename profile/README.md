## What we build -- with the help of the community

### [Funix.io](https://github.com/TexteaInc/Funix) -- The laziest way to build web apps in Python

* Build web apps without manually creating widgets -- or do it declaratively when needed. 
* Automatic UI generation and widget choosing from the type hints in the signature of a function.
* Non-intrusive and effortless: turn Python functions or classes into apps via as little as one command. 

### [LlaMaKey](https://github.com/TexteaInc/LlaMasterKey)

Key management for multiple users and multiple cloud LLM/GenAI APIs is hasslesome and risk-prone. LlaMaKey gives each user one master key to access multiple cloud AI APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, AnyScale, HuggingFace, Perplexity) through their official SDKs with no code change nor knowing the actual API keys. So the actual API key is secure -- never known to users, and the life of both the user and the administrator is made easy. 

### [json-viewer](https://github.com/TexteaInc/json-viewer)

Data viewer for react component. Customizable and ready to use.
